In terminal type
bundle gem name_of_project
this will create the folder structure you want

You want to start your programming with a shell of what the cli should do (with out the smarts in the background) then you can refine the scraping and advanced methods in the background


The Bin exeucatble file needs the below line of code so that the program knows to read the code as ruby
        #!/usr/bin/env ruby

the bin should contain an executable file that the user essentially interracts with
you can lookup the file permissions of the file by typing below into editor:
        ls -lah
        #more permissions
        https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/checking-linux-file-permissions-with-ls/

when you review the permissions :
        r = read
        w = write
        x - execuctable

if your executable file does not contain x, then it is more difficult for the user to directly call the program from the cli prompt
to give executabel permission to the file you must type the following in terminal:
        chmod +x daily-deal
        #above daily-deal is the name of the executable file
        # after the change you can now execute the file by typing the below text directly into terminal:
            ./bin/daily-deal
        #this teaches our operating system how to interpeate ruby (using the shabing header line)

setup the bones - methods call, list, menu, goodby
--------------------------------
then setup the higher thinking of your code
